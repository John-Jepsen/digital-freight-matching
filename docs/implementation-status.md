## Technical Achievements

### Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Monolith**: Faster development, easier debugging
- **Service Layer**: Clean separation of business logic
- **RESTful API**: Standard, scalable endpoint design
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database with JSONB
- **Redis**: High-performance caching and sessions
- **Docker**: Consistent development environment

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized queries for load search
- **Route Caching**: 2-hour cache for Google Maps responses
- **Service Layer**: Isolated business logic for testing
- **Background Jobs**: Async processing with Sidekiq
- **CORS Optimization**: Specific origin configuration

### Security Implementation
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless, secure token system
- **Row-Level Security**: Database-level access control
- **Environment Variables**: No hardcoded secrets
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive model validations
- **HTTPS Ready**: TLS configuration for production

## Sprint Completions

### Sprint 2 Completion
**Completed**: July 2025  

**Major Achievements**:
- Service layer extraction (6 core services)
- Missing model implementations (5 models)
- Google Maps integration framework
- Complete controller implementations (3 controllers)
- Database schema optimization
- RESTful API completion

**Technical Details**:
- 15 new migration files with proper indexing
- 6 business logic services with comprehensive testing
- 25+ API endpoints with full CRUD operations
