# Legacy Documentation

This folder contains the original documentation files that have been reorganized and consolidated into the new documentation structure.

## Original Files

- **DOCS.md** → Consolidated into [project-overview.md](../project-overview.md)
- **PROJECT_GUIDE.md** → Split between [architecture.md](../architecture.md) and [project-overview.md](../project-overview.md)
- **API_DOCS.md** → Enhanced and moved to [api-reference.md](../api-reference.md)
- **IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md** → Updated and moved to [implementation-status.md](../implementation-status.md)
- **SPRINT_2_COMPLETION.md** → Incorporated into [implementation-status.md](../implementation-status.md)
- **UML_Design.md** → Database design moved to [database.md](../database.md), architecture to [architecture.md](../architecture.md)
- **SECURITY.md** → Enhanced and moved to [security.md](../security.md)
- **SECURITY_VERIFICATION.md** → Incorporated into [security.md](../security.md)
- **GOOGLE_MAPS_SETUP.md** → Moved to [configuration.md](../configuration.md)

## What Changed

### Improvements Made:
1. **Eliminated Redundancy**: Combined overlapping content from multiple files
2. **Better Organization**: Logical grouping by topic (getting started, development, architecture, etc.)
3. **Updated Information**: Refreshed all content to reflect current state (July 2025)
4. **Enhanced Detail**: Added more comprehensive examples and explanations
5. **Consistent Format**: Standardized formatting and navigation across all docs

### New Structure Benefits:
- **Single Source of Truth**: No more conflicting information
- **Easy Navigation**: Clear document index and cross-references
- **Development Focus**: Separate docs for different user needs (developers, business, ops)
- **Maintenance**: Easier to keep documentation up-to-date
