# Digital Freight Matching System - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The Digital Freight Matching System is a comprehensive platform designed to optimize freight logistics by connecting shippers, carriers, and brokers through intelligent matching algorithms. This system addresses key challenges in the trucking industry including deadhead trucking, operational inefficiencies, and high operational costs.

## Problem Statement

### Industry Challenges
