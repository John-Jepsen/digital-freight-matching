# Project Overview

The Digital Freight Matching Platform addresses critical inefficiencies in the trucking industry through intelligent matching algorithms and optimization.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

### Industry Challenges

**Deadhead Trucking Crisis**
- 25-35% of truck miles driven empty
- $50+ billion annual waste in the US alone
- Increased fuel costs and environmental impact

**Market Fragmentation**
- 70% of trucking companies have only one power unit
- Manual, inefficient load-to-carrier matching
- Poor coordination between shippers and carriers

**Operational Inefficiencies**
- High operational costs ($1.855 average cost-per-mile)
- Poor route planning and backhaul opportunities
- Time-consuming manual processes

## 💡 Solution Approach

### Digital Freight Matching Platform

**Core Features:**
1. **AI-Powered Matching**: Real-time load-to-carrier optimization
